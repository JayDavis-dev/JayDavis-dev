Learning repos, pull requests, Actions, and Advanced Security.  
*And yes, Copilot is helping me write some of this.*

### ðŸŒ± Outside of work  
Husband. Father. Nerd.  
When Iâ€™m not working or with my family, Iâ€™m probably watching One Piece, playing a round of golf, or rage quitting in Elden Ring.
